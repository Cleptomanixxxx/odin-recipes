    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Made with only a few simple ingredients, these spicy chipotle chicken burgers will be on the grill in no time.
        Topped with gouda cheese, mayonnaise, lettuce, and mango salsa, they're just the right combination of spicy and
        cool.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
        <li>1/3 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped red onion</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 lime, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>5 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced</li>
        <li>1 mango - peeled, seeded, and chopped</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices gouda cheese</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine ground chicken, breadcrumbs, chopped onion, egg, lime zest, cilantro, garlic, and chipotle in a
            bowl. Shape mixture into four 1/4-pound patties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, stir together chopped mangoes and the juice of the lime in a small bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill chicken burgers on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink inside, juices run clear, and
            burgers show browned grill marks, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
            center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            About 2 minutes before burgers are done, place hamburger buns onto the grill to toast, about 1 minute per
            side. About 1 minute before the burgers are done, top each burger with a slice of Gouda cheese, and let
            melt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread each bun with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise and top with 1/4 cup shredded lettuce and grilled chicken
            burger. Spoon 1/4 of mango-lime mixture on each burger and top with the other half of the bun to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
