            Melt butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in mushrooms and thyme sprigs; cook,
            stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs.
            Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and Worcestershire sauce. Transfer mushroom mixture to a bowl; keep warm for
            serving. Wipe out skillet.
